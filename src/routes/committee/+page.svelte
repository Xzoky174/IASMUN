Moreover, I fully comprehend the effort and dedication required for MUN, and how uneasy one may feel at a first conference, but rest assured, you will grow to love the experience it brings, and would want to participate in as many future conferences as you can. I hope you take this opportunity to speak your mind and make it a fun experience overall.

				"My name is Rahaf Ahmed, and I am a junior at IAS. I am thrilled to have been appointed co-chair of my school's model United Nations. I hope that by participating in this event, you will be able to showcase your strongest research, teamwork, debate, critical thinking, and public speaking abilities. As co-chair, it is my responsibility to encourage all delegates to do their best and make the most of this experience, as it has the potential to enhance their self-confidence and public speaking skills. Taking part in model UN not only brings me great joy and excitement but also provides me with valuable experience and skills for my desired career path. I want to be a lawyer, and as important as preparation is, the ability to think on your feet is equally important when defending your client. Model UN can teach you both these skills. Although Model United Nations is a great learning experience and I encourage all of you to take it very seriously, I know that some of you may feel nervous or uneasy at first, but I assure you that it is a lot of fun and that you will want to participate again after your first time. Moreover, I understand how privileged and lucky I am and I will do my best to serve as a co chair in my committee and I wish you all the best of luck! ",
