			My passion for politics and debate has always been strong. But my passion grew after my first MUN. I enjoyed it so much that I switched to international relations from law.
			<br /><br />
			I pushed for an Arab League in English committee for this year's IASMUN. Several Middle Eastern countries, some of which are in the spotlight while others are overlooked, face significant challenges that motivated this decision.
			<br /><br />
			Our generation possesses a strong awareness of global affairs; therefore, I have selected ongoing conflicts that provoke strong opinions from all of us, and it's crucial that I give our youth a place to debate and innovate.
			<br /><br />
			With that being said, I extend a warm welcome to you at IASMUN. I hope that this experience provides you with the opportunity to improve your public speaking abilities, debate skills, research capabilities, quick thinking abilities, and confidence.
