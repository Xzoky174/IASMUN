I had a positive experience with MUN in my previous high school, so I am well-equipped and qualified for the role of co-chair. We want to ensure that the delegates feel safe and firm to exchange ideas and observations of their assigned countries during the debates in a constructive respectful manner and not behave in a way that will destroy the competitive spirit of MUN or make it seem like a hostile environment. And last but not least, best of luck to everyone involved for IAS's 2023 MUN!",cochair_photo:yt},{class:"UNODC",name:"United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)",biography:"The United Nations Of Drugs and Crime is a United Nations office created in 1997 as the Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention by fusing the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Division at the United Nations Office in Vienna with the United Nations International Drug Control Program (UNDCP).
